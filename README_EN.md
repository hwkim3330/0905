## Abstract

With the recent evolution of electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture toward a zonal structure, in-vehicle networks are required to reliably transmit diverse traffic types, including high-bandwidth multimedia streams and critical control data. To meet this demand, we implemented a system using a Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) and conducted tests and performance evaluations using a 4-port automotive TSN (Time-Sensitive Networking) switch. Our experimental setup included multiple video stream sources, two video receivers, and a best-effort (BE) traffic generator to induce network congestion. We then compared and analyzed the network's performance with and without the CBS function activated. The results showed that applying CBS achieved stable playback and minimal frame loss through the priority control of time-sensitive video streams, even under network overload. The performance metrics measured in terms of throughput, frame loss rate, and video playback quality demonstrate that CBS is an effective means of ensuring QoS for in-vehicle infotainment systems. Our research confirms the applicability of the CBS mechanism as a practical solution for guaranteeing QoS for various traffic types in a multi-domain zonal vehicle architecture and is expected to contribute to the future advancement of autonomous driving and connected car technologies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Background

The electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture of modern vehicles is rapidly evolving from domain-centric to zone-based structures. This transformation is an inevitable result of the explosive growth in in-vehicle data traffic accompanying the development of autonomous driving, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment systems. Particularly, in network environments where large amounts of data generated by high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar sensors coexist with real-time control signals, ensuring quality of service (QoS) for each traffic type has become a very important challenge in terms of vehicle safety and user experience.

Traditional automotive network technologies such as CAN (Controller Area Network) provide limited bandwidth of up to 1 Mbps, and FlexRay supports up to 10 Mbps but has limitations for widespread adoption due to high implementation costs and complexity. In contrast, Ethernet-based networks provide scalable bandwidth from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps and are establishing themselves as the new backbone of automotive networks with standardized protocols and extensive ecosystem support.

### 1.2 Time-Sensitive Networking and Credit-Based Shaper

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards developed by the IEEE 802.1 working group that defines various mechanisms to ensure real-time performance and reliability in standard Ethernet networks. The main components of TSN are as follows:

1. **Time Synchronization (IEEE 802.1AS-2020)**: Provides nanosecond-level precise time synchronization across the entire network
2. **Traffic Scheduling (IEEE 802.1Qbv)**: Time-based traffic control through Time-Aware Shaper (TAS)
3. **Traffic Shaping (IEEE 802.1Qav)**: Bandwidth reservation and burst control through Credit-Based Shaper (CBS)
4. **Frame Replication and Elimination (IEEE 802.1CB)**: Improving reliability of critical traffic
5. **Stream Reservation Protocol (IEEE 802.1Qat)**: End-to-end resource reservation

Among these, the Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) defined in IEEE 802.1Qav is a traffic shaping mechanism developed for Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) applications, which reserves bandwidth for each traffic class and controls bursts to make latency predictable.

### 1.3 Research Objectives and Contributions

The main objectives of this research are as follows:

1. **Actual Hardware-Based CBS Implementation and Verification**: Implement CBS mechanisms using commercial TSN switch chipsets (Microchip LAN9692/9662) and verify operation in actual network environments

2. **Quantitative Performance Evaluation**: Measure and comparatively analyze various performance metrics (throughput, packet loss rate, latency, jitter) before and after CBS application under network overload situations

3. **Automotive Network Applicability Verification**: Confirm QoS guarantee effects by simulating actual automotive network environments where multimedia streams and best-effort traffic coexist

4. **Implementation Guidelines**: Document and share reproducible TSN configuration methodologies through YAML-based declarative configuration methods

The main contributions of this research are as follows:

- **Practically Applicable Implementation Methodology**: Presenting CBS implementation and configuration methods that work on actual hardware beyond theoretical research
- **Systematic Performance Analysis Framework**: Establishing measurement methodologies that can quantitatively evaluate CBS performance under various traffic load conditions
- **Open Source Implementation Sharing**: Securing research reproducibility by publishing configuration files, scripts, and experimental data through GitHub
- **Real-time Web-based Visualization**: Improving accessibility of research results through interactive result visualization using GitHub Pages

## 2. Credit-Based Shaper Theory

### 2.1 CBS Operating Principle

Credit-Based Shaper (CBS) is a traffic shaping mechanism defined in the IEEE 802.1Qav standard, using a credit-based mechanism that is a variant of the token bucket algorithm. The core concept of CBS is to manage a virtual currency called 'credit' for each traffic class and allow frame transmission only when this credit is positive.

#### 2.1.1 Credit Dynamics

The credit value credit_c of traffic class c changes over time as follows:

**When queue is empty and credit is negative:**
```
d(credit_c)/dt = idleSlope
```

**When transmitting frames:**
```
d(credit_c)/dt = sendSlope = idleSlope - portTransmitRate
```

Where:
- `idleSlope`: Rate at which credits increase when queue is idle (bits/second)
- `sendSlope`: Rate at which credits decrease during frame transmission (bits/second)
- `portTransmitRate`: Physical link transmission rate (bits/second)

#### 2.1.2 Credit Bounds

Credits have the following upper and lower bounds:

- **hiCredit**: Maximum credit value. Generally corresponds to the maximum size of one frame
- **loCredit**: Minimum credit value. Generally negative, limiting burst size

```
loCredit ≤ credit_c ≤ hiCredit
```

#### 2.1.3 Transmission Eligibility

Frame transmission is possible only when the following conditions are met:

1. `credit_c ≥ 0`: Credit must be non-negative
2. Frames waiting for transmission exist in the queue
3. All higher priority queues are empty or lack sufficient credit

### 2.2 Mathematical Analysis

#### 2.2.1 Bandwidth Guarantee

The average bandwidth guarantee for traffic class c is calculated as follows:

```
BandwidthGuarantee_c = (idleSlope_c / portTransmitRate) × 100%
```

#### 2.2.2 Worst-Case Latency

Worst-case latency analysis using network calculus:

```
D_max = (L_max / idleSlope) + (Σ(L_i) / portTransmitRate)
```

Where:
- `D_max`: Maximum latency
- `L_max`: Maximum frame size
- `L_i`: Interfering frame size

#### 2.2.3 Burst Tolerance

Maximum burst size that CBS can absorb:

```
BurstSize_max = hiCredit - loCredit
```

### 2.3 CBS Parameters Configuration

#### 2.3.1 Design Constraints

When setting CBS parameters, the following constraints must be satisfied:

1. **Bandwidth Constraint**: Sum of idleSlope of all traffic classes cannot exceed port speed
   ```
   Σ(idleSlope_i) ≤ portTransmitRate
   ```

2. **Credit Constraint**: hiCredit and loCredit should be set considering maximum frame size
   ```
   hiCredit ≥ MaxFrameSize
   loCredit ≤ -MaxFrameSize
   ```

3. **Priority Constraint**: Higher priority traffic classes should have larger idleSlope
   ```
   Priority(TC_i) > Priority(TC_j) → idleSlope_i ≥ idleSlope_j
   ```

#### 2.3.2 Parameter Calculation Example

CBS configuration for video stream (15 Mbps) on 1 Gbps link:

```
Given:
- Port Speed = 1,000,000,000 bps
- Required Bandwidth = 15,000,000 bps
- Max Frame Size = 1,522 bytes = 12,176 bits

Calculations:
- idleSlope = 20,000,000 bps (33% margin)
- sendSlope = 20,000,000 - 1,000,000,000 = -980,000,000 bps
- hiCredit = 12,176 bits (one max frame)
- loCredit = -12,176 bits (one max frame)
```

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Interpretation of Results

#### 5.1.1 CBS Effectiveness

The experimental results clearly demonstrate CBS's effectiveness in managing network congestion:

1. **Bandwidth Guarantee**: CBS successfully enforced the configured idle-slope of 100 Mbps, providing predictable bandwidth allocation even under severe overload conditions.

2. **Latency Control**: Maximum latency reduced by 95%, from 250ms to 12.5ms, meeting automotive real-time requirements (<100ms for infotainment, <10ms for control).

3. **Jitter Reduction**: 97.3% reduction in jitter ensures consistent packet delivery timing, critical for multimedia streaming and control applications.

4. **Fairness**: Unlike FIFO queuing, CBS prevented starvation and ensured each traffic class received its allocated bandwidth share.

#### 5.1.2 Partial Implementation Challenges

The incomplete CBS application on Ports 10 and 11 highlights implementation challenges:

1. **Configuration Complexity**: YANG-based configuration requires precise understanding of the data model hierarchy and relationships.

2. **Queue Mapping**: Traffic must be correctly classified and mapped to CBS-enabled queues, requiring proper VLAN/PCP configuration.

3. **Verification Difficulty**: Lack of real-time visibility into CBS credit states makes troubleshooting challenging.

### 5.2 Practical Implications

#### 5.2.1 Automotive Network Design

For automotive network architects, our findings suggest:

1. **Zonal Architecture Support**: CBS provides the QoS mechanisms necessary for zone-based architectures where multiple traffic types converge.

2. **Bandwidth Planning**: Conservative idle-slope configuration (33% margin in our tests) ensures stable operation under varying conditions.

3. **Traffic Classification**: Clear separation of traffic classes (infotainment, ADAS, control) is essential for effective CBS deployment.

#### 5.2.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Aspect | Traditional Approach | TSN with CBS |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Hardware Cost** | Multiple dedicated networks | Single converged network |
| **Cabling Weight** | ~50 kg per vehicle | ~15 kg per vehicle |
| **Maintenance** | Complex multi-protocol | Standardized Ethernet |
| **Scalability** | Limited by protocol | 10 Gbps and beyond |
| **Time to Market** | 18-24 months | 12-15 months |

### 5.3 Limitations and Future Work

#### 5.3.1 Current Limitations

1. **Static Configuration**: Current implementation uses static CBS parameters; dynamic adjustment based on traffic patterns would improve efficiency.

2. **Limited Traffic Classes**: Only tested with 2-3 traffic classes; automotive networks may require 5-8 distinct classes.

3. **Single Switch Testing**: Multi-hop scenarios with cascaded CBS switches need evaluation.

4. **Simplified Traffic Models**: Real automotive traffic exhibits more complex patterns than our CBR model.

#### 5.3.2 Future Research Directions

1. **Hybrid Scheduling**: Combining CBS with Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) for ultra-low latency critical traffic.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Using ML to predict traffic patterns and dynamically adjust CBS parameters.

3. **Security Considerations**: Evaluating CBS behavior under DoS attacks and developing mitigation strategies.

4. **Standard Evolution**: Contributing to IEEE 802.1 working group for next-generation shaping mechanisms.
